# hello-world
My first repository
Hello world, my name is Kaden Garnaas! I am a junior at Boise State Studying computer science. This is my first taste of using Git but I've enjoyed what I've learned so far.
In my free time I like to play basketball, watch all sporting events, hang out with my friends, and continue learning to code!
